# Web Matters resources

Repo to store and develop a multitude of helpful resources for the Web Matters website.

These resources should provide general information on a range of topics that are relevant to the web and the people who work on it. These resources should be factual in nature. Where possible, link to authoritative and established sources. For example, a resource focusing on TUPE regulations for employees who are part of an acquisition would likely link to the [ACAS guidance](http://www.acas.org.uk/index.aspx?articleid=1655) on the subject.

All these documents are drafts; when complete, they will be published on the [Web Matters website](https://www.web-matters.co.uk/). Visit the website if you'd like to be involved in the organisation.

## Contributing

Fork this repository, then create a new feature branch. When you have something that you would like others to review, raise a pull request against the master branch of the `web-matters/website-resources` repo.

Unless you are making formatting changes to lots of resources at once, please don't include multiple unrelated resources in a single branch/PR.

## TODO

* Outline content structure - top-level categories, subcategories etc.
* Create resource template.
* Create some resources!
